# Final Project - Frieda and Paula
The program is an interactive, Python-based learning platform that combines spaced repetition 
with gamification to make studying more engaging and visually rewarding. At its core, 
users create or import flashcard decks to review educational content. 
Each session spent playing learning-focused minigames 
contributes to the growth of a virtual plantâ€”starting from a seed and evolving 
through various life stages like sprout, leaf, and bloom.
As users invest more time, new minigames unlock, each reinforcing knowledge in 
fun and varied ways.
